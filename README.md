# GPS-Research
This project serves the purpose of simulating a traffic simulation. We seek to reroute traffic in the case of congestion. We will be using raspberry pi's to collect gps data. We will have a raspberry pi that will collect all gps data and determine what each client pi needs to do to get to its destination in the least amount of time while not causing more congestioon by taking the same route.
#We will be using ChipKit Pro MX4 boards mounted to drive our robots that recieve instruction from raspberr pi's on board.


#TODO:
Switch the robot to only have one microcontroller on board that gathers gps data and drives the robot.
Switch from a raspberry pi gathering data to a IoT platform that will gather data and run a program communicating to clients. Also track the clients on google maps wiget to see where devices are.
